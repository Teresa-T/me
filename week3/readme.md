TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
exercise1 :
- The command to check for value types is isinstance
- Remember to add a terminating condition for a while loop
- Can use the word not to mean False for a Boolean condition
    - Ex. not 3 means != 3 and not True means != True

exercise3 :
- Copy and paste function to simplify the code (instead of applying it to every case)
    - (Do not know how to use global functions yet)
    - == means 'equal to' or 'the same as'
        - = means assignment, not 'equal to'

exercise4 :
- Using Binary Search (lower or higher), use more than and less than while updating the range boundaries
    - least amount of tries (on average)
    - the computer cannot guess randomly (cannot guess in 1 try)
    - limit the range by updating range boundaries (with -1 and +1, as the high/lower is not inclusive)
